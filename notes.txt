- First do a simple model with pie and labour+capital share. Everything is measured in production units
    - Industry produces a certain amount of production units each turn. This is determined by productivity*labour 
    - Some fixed amount goes to wages, some fixed amount goes to constant capital, the rest goes to profit
    - The amount of production units that are spent on constant capital is determined by production capacity of the industry
        - Production capacity is also measured in production units
        - Under-investement in constant capital will cause production capacity to fall
        - The amount of people that can be employed is a function of production capacity
        - The constant capital cost is a function of production capacity (and employement) (and productivity?)
    - If capital spends more than constant capital in an industry, that industry can grow either in production capacity or in productivity
    - Somehow productivity is limited by the current research level, where research is it's own state-managed industry that eats up production units
      but does not produce production units, instead produces research
    - Need to work out the optimal local decisions to make:
        - Industry Income = productivity * labour
        - Profit = Income - Constant Capital - Wages
        - An increase in production capacity by a gives:
            - newProfit = a*Income - a*(Constant Capital + Wages) = a*currentProfit
        - If this costs b, over (say) 5 years we have 
            - 5*a*currentProfit - b or currentProfit - b/5 yearly profit 
            - which means yearly profit has changed (a-1)*currentProfit - b/5 
        - Whereas an increase in productivity by a for an increase in constant capital by b gives:
            - newProfit > oldProfit
            - a*Income - b*ConstantCapital - Wages > Income - ConstantCapital - Wages
            - a*Income - b*ConstantCapital > Income - ConstantCapital
            - (a - 1)*Income > (b-1)*ConstantCapital
            - IE the change in profit is (a-1)*Income - (b-1)*ConstantCapital
        - If this costs c, then over say 5 years, we have
            - a*Income - b*ConstantCapital - Wages - c/5 yearly average profit
            - (a - 1)*Income - (b-1)*ConstantCapital - c/5 change in yearly average profit
        - The question is now: what should b_cap and b_prod and c_prod be? 
            - Probably b_cap should vary with ConstantCapital/Labour, and be high. 
            - b_prod should probably be somewhat high, but vary with research
            - c_prod should be relatively low, but perhaps also vary with research
        - Capital will also need to know if there is manpower or goods shortages, as this will affect how they invest
    - Production units are converted back into different needs following some utility hierarchy. Government can then
    subsidies the cost of certain needs. Needs can be broken down into several levels and the utility can be completed step
    by step, with a greedy algorthm making the best current choice
    - So, main event loop goes:
        - Industry produces. Then Capital re-invests and Pops consume. Taxes and subsidies are applied during this process.
    - Investement becomes increasingly expensive as more is invested within a single turn (?)
    - There are different simple models for how investements could work
        - It could be discrete, that way making a choice is easier
            - Obvious problems with this is what happens when there isnt enough money
            - Perhaps a midway solution would be to just have a maximal investement
        - Choice of where to invest could be done on the immediate proportion return
            - This seems the easiest and it seems like it would behave smoothly
            - Funds could close off to external investement when they have too much money already
            - Any funds that have nowhere reasonable to invest their surplus value will just consume it instead
    - Should be writing tests ASAP!!! Should be commenting code!!
    - Need to work on utility calculation, for now just introduce housing and healthcare maybe?
    - Need to work on government intervention, taxes, policies ect...
    - Need to work on govenment setup, the parliament, the parties, the factions(?) etc..
    - Do some cleanup on the Nation class before moving forward. Refactor into individual functions if possible
    - How could laws work? Bills could be their own objects built through composition that can manipulate the existing
      laws held by the nation object (e.g. taxProps) and have an associate ideology etc... Bills will need some info
      to decide on ideology and things, so a lot of things might have to be passed in

CODE NOTES:
    - Should be writing tests ASAP!!! Should be commenting code!!
    - Should be pulling functionality out into independent funciton asap
    - Start writing GUI
    - Replace pairs with decompositions
    - apply tax system
    - change ideology system so that radical comes first

suppose we have a cabinet, made up of ministers that are actual electors
can this just be several raw pointers? the pointers would be pointing to objects in electors vector
whos address may change. Othewise it could hold some id, and query the vector using the id. Maybe the vector is a map instead
Is any of this going to be more efficient than just dynamically allocating objects? At least the memory is contiguous
if we dont allocate objects
If we hold an id to query the electors and make it into a map instead, we can just get passed in const refs of the elector map in
order to act on it
